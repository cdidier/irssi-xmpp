==============

1.1 How can I automatically load irssi-xmpp at irssi startup ?

  Simply put "load xmpp" in your startup file (~/.irssi/startup):
      echo "load xmpp" >> ~/.irssi/startup

1.2 How can I automatically connect to my account at irssi startup ?

  You can put these things in your config file (The config file can be
  found here : "~/.irssi/config"):

  To create a XMPP network, add to chatnets section:
    <network> = {
      type = "XMPP";
      nick = "<jid>";
    };

  Then you can add this at the end of the servers section:
    {
      address = "<address>";
      port="<port>";
      use_ssl = "{yes|no}";
      chatnet = "<network>";
      password = "<password>";
      autoconnect = "{yes|no}";
    };
  
  Or in irssi, you can type this:
      /SERVER ADD -xmppnet <network> <address> <port> <password> <jid>

  If 0 is specified as port, the default port will be used (5222 for a
  regular connection or 5223 for SSL).
  
  Now you can connect to your jabber account by typing:
      /CONNECT <network>
  Or just restart irssi if you have set autoconnect to yes.

1.3 How can I use my gmail/gtalk account ?

  You have to use the server "talk.google.com", so the command is:
      /XMPPCONNET -host talk.google.com <jid> <password>

  You don't need to specify the -ssl switch because STARTTLS will be
  used automatically.

2. General:
===========

2.1 Why the lagmeter is not working ?

  The server need to support the XEP-0199 (XMPP Ping). If it doesn't
  support it, the lagmeter won't work.

  If your server support the XMPP Ping, maybe you didn't add the
  composing item in the statusbar. Take a look at the file GENERAL
  (section "Composing in the statusbar:).

2.2 How can I be away on all servers (both IRC servers and XMPP
servers) ?

  Simply use this command:
      /foreach server /away -one <reason>

  Or set up an alias like this
      /alias aaway /foreach server /away -one

3. Scripting:
=============

3.1 How can I use or write scripts with irssi-xmpp ?

    ...

3.2 My script seems to be incompatible with irssi-xmpp and throws warnings 
such as: Can't locate object method "xxx" via package "Irssi::Xmpp::Server".
How can I get rid of that ?

  Basically, it's because the script is IRC-specific and won't work with
  an XMPP server. Try to add a condition in the functions of your script
  to verify if the server is an IRC server and simply return if it is
  not.

4. Themes:
==========

4.1 How can I change the theme of the messages of irssi-xmpp ?

  In the same way you can change the theme of the messages of irssi.
  Take a look at the source file src/fe-common/module-formats.c to see
  the whole list of irssi-xmpp messages.
