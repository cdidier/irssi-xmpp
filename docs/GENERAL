General commands:
=================

These commands are the general commands for a basic usage of irssi-xmpp.

You may notice that some commands accept as parameter a JID, a full JID
(a JID with a resource) or a name. If you specify a name, it will be
resolved through the roster. But if the name cannot be found in your
roster, irssi-xmpp will assume that the name is a JID.

Some commands require a full JID, but if you type only a JID or a name,
these commands will automatically use the highest resource for this
contact in your roster.

/QUERY <jid>[/<resource>]
/QUERY <name>
    Starts a private conversation with the JID. If the user is online and 
    the resource isn't specified, the conversation window will be on the
    resource with the highest priority.

/MSG <jid>[/<resource>] <message>
    Sends a message to a jid. There is no name resolution through the roster so
    the jid must be valid. (Prefer /QUERY if you want a normal discussion in
    a query window.)

/ME <message>
    Sends an "ACTION", useable in a query or in a room.

/AWAY [away|chat|dnd|xa] <reason>
    This command marks you as being "away". If the away mode isn't specified,
    the "xmpp_default_away_mode" setting will be used. You can remove your away
    status by using AWAY with no arguments.

/ROSTER
    Shows your contacts in a list.

/ROSTER FULL
    Shows all your contacts in a list, even those who are offline.

/ROSTER ADD [-nosub] <jid>
    Adds a JID to your contact list. (Use the parameter "-nosub" if you
    don't want to send a subscribe request.)

/ROSTER REMOVE <jid>
    Removes a JID from your contact list. The subscriptions will be removed too.

/ROSTER NAME <jid> <name>
    Changes the name (or nickname) of a JID.

/ROSTER GROUP <jid> <group>
    Changes the group of a JID.

/WHOIS <jid>
/WHOIS <name>
    Requests the vcard related to the JID.

/VER <jid>/<resource>
/VER <name>
    Requests the software version of the resource.

/QUOTE <data>
    Sends server raw data without parsing. You need to make sure the value is
    XML valid.

/XMPPCONNECT [-ssl] [-host <host>] [-port <port>]
             <jid>[/<resource>] <password>
/XMPPSERVER [-ssl] [-host <host>] [-port <port>]
            <jid>[/<resource>] <password>
    See the "Connection" section of the STARTUP file.

Subscription commands:
======================

These commands are useful if you want to manage the subscription of your
contacts.

/PRESENCE ACCEPT <jid>
    Accepts a subscription request, so the contact will be able to see your
    presence.

/PRESENCE DENY <jid>
    Denies a subscription, so the contact won't see your presence anymore.

/PRESENCE SUBSCRIBE <jid> <reason>
    Sends a subscription request to a JID. If the contact accepts your request,
    you'll be able to see his/her presence.

/PRESENCE UNSUBSCRIBE <jid>
    Unsubscribes to the contact's presence, so you won't see his/her presence
    anymore.

Subscription status:
====================

These are the subscription status displayed in the roster list with their
description:

both: The contact and you can see each other's presence. (not displayed)
from: The contact can see your presence.  
to: You can see the contact's presence.
none: The contact and you cannot see each other's presence.
