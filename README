About:
======

irssi-xmpp is an irssi plugin to connect to the Jabber network.

Installation:
=============

Requirement:
    o Loudmouth 1.x (http://www.loudmouth-project.org/)
    o Irssi and its sources unpacked and configured (http://irssi.org/)
    o GNU make

Procedure:
    $ export IRSSI_INCLUDE=/path/to/irssi/sources
    $ make
    $ make user-install

Note: On non-Linux systems (e.g. *BSD) you might need to use "gmake" instead of
"make".

Running irssi-xmpp:
===================

Usage:
    /LOAD xmpp

Simply load the module in irssi. Currently you cannot load it automatically,
unless using a script or something like that.

The module must be placed in "~/.irssi/modules/", or you should load it with
the full path.

You can unload it using:
    /UNLOAD xmpp

Connection:
===========

Usage:
    /XMPPCONNECT [-ssl] [-host <host>] [-port <port>]
                 <jid>[/<resource>] <password>

The "jid" is your Jabber ID (something like "username@server"). You can add
"/<resource>" at the end of the "jid" to set your own resource.


You can put these things in your config file (The config file can be found
here : "~.irssi/config"):

To create a XMPP network, add to "chatnets" section,
    <network> = { type = "XMPP"; nick = "<jid>[/<resource>]"; };
For example:
    "xmpp:username@server" = { type = "XMPP"; nick = "username@server/resource"; };

Then you can add this to "servers" section:
    { address = "<address>"; port="<port>"; use_ssl = "{yes|no}"; chatnet = "<network>"; password = "<password>"; };
For example:
    { address = "server"; port="5223"; use_ssl = "yes"; chatnet = "xmpp:username@server"; password = "password"; };

Now you can connect to your jabber account by typing:
    /CONNECT <network>


The old connection command still available:
    /SERVER [-ssl] -xmppnet <network> <address> <port> <password> <jid>

Register:
=========

Currently, you cannot register an account with irssi-xmpp. You must do that
with another client.

=================

/MSG <jid>[/<resource>] <message>
    Send a message to a jid.

/AWAY [away|chat|dnd|xa] <reason>

irssi-xmpp was inspired by irssi-jabber, another jabber module for irssi which
was written by Chistian Häggström. (http://kalvdans.no-ip.org/trac/irssi-jabber)
